All those who were outside had to come in. 
And many of them just sat around us and started watching our gameplay. 
Some even joined.
I usually suck at carrom.
But I found this new confidence in me.
I performed much better and won too.
We talked and I cracked a joke.
And most of them laughed. 
This never happened to me before. 
That was the best time ever.
